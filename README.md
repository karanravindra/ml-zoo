## Overview
This repository contains a collection reusable machine learning models and utilities. The goal is to provide a set of tools that can be easily integrated into other projects. The models are implemented using PyTorch and are designed to be easily extended and modified. Inspired by projects like [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning).
